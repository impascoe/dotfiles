## catppuccin_macchiato.omp.json
This is my slightly tweaked version of the catppuccin macchiato oh-my-posh theme. 
Pretty similar, just changed a couple of the colors around.

Full credit goes to [Oh My Posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/) for making such an awesome piece of software!
