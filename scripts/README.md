## sdu.sh
To use this, make sure you are using a Fedora based distribution, as this uses `dnf` commands.

Also, make sure if you actually use this, that flatpak is installed, as this also uses `flatpak update` at the same time for
my convenience.

To use this, just insert `source (file location)/sdu.sh` in your shell config file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc) and call `sdu`.
