# Dotfiles

I needed a spot to put them so here they are.

## sdu.sh
To use this, make sure you are using a Fedora based distribution, as this uses `dnf` commands.

Also, make sure if you actually use this, that flatpak is installed, as this also uses `flatpak update` at the same time for
my convenience.

## config.jsonc
This is just my custom fastfetch config file.

## catppuccin_macchiato.omp.json
This is my slightly tweaked version of the catppuccin macchiato oh-my-posh theme. 
Pretty similar, just changed a couple of the colors around.
